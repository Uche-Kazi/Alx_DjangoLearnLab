Thank you for visiting. We hope to see you again soon!

Login again {# Optional: A logout button that sends a POST request for more explicit logout #} {# This is often used on a page where the user is already logged in, not on the "logged out" page itself #} {# However, if you want a dedicated "confirm logout" page, this is how you'd do it. #} {# For now, the redirect in views.py to this page means the logout already happened. #} {# The primary purpose of this template is just to display the "logged out" message. #}
