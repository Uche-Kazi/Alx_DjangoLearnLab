Intermediate Library Project Folder
This LibraryProject directory acts as an intermediate container within the django-models project root. It holds the main Django project configuration (the inner LibraryProject package) and the custom applications, such as relationship_app.

This specific nesting is based on a successful project structure for the "Implementing Advanced Model Relationships in Django" task.

Contents
LibraryProject/: The inner Django project package containing settings.py, urls.py, etc., and now also containing the relationship_app.

(Other potential app folders like bookshelf/, templates/ if copied from previous tasks)
