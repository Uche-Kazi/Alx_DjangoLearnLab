Inner Library Project Configuration
This LibraryProject directory is the actual core configuration package for the Django project. It contains essential project-wide settings and URL routing. This package is nested within an intermediate LibraryProject folder, which itself is inside the django-models project root.

Contents
settings.py: Defines all Django project settings, including database configuration, installed applications, middleware, and static files.

urls.py: Manages the main URL routing for the entire Django project.

wsgi.py: Entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.

asgi.py: Entry point for ASGI-compatible web servers (e.g., for websockets).

__init__.py: Marks this directory as a Python package.

Important Notes
Modifications to project-wide behavior or adding new apps should often involve changes within settings.py.

App-specific URLs can be included from this urls.py file.
