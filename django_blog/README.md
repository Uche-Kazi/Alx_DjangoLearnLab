Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
What you need to install the software:

Python 3.x

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/django_blog.git

Create a virtual environment:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:
(Assuming you have a requirements.txt file. If not, you'll need to install Django directly)

# If you have a requirements.txt, use:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

Database Setup
Apply migrations:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Create a superuser (admin account):
This allows you to access the Django admin panel.

Follow the prompts to create a username, email, and password.
