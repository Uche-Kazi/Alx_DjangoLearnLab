Comment System Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the comment functionality implemented in the Django blog project. It details how users can interact with comments, including adding new comments, viewing existing ones, and managing their own comments through editing and deletion.

1. Introduction
The comment system enhances user engagement by allowing visitors to provide feedback and participate in discussions directly on the blog posts. This feature enriches the content by fostering a community around each article.

2. Comment Model Overview
The Comment model (defined in blog/models.py) stores all comment-related data. Here's a breakdown of its fields:

post: A ForeignKey that links each comment to a specific Post object. This establishes a many-to-one relationship, meaning multiple comments can belong to a single post.

author: A ForeignKey to Django's built-in User model. This identifies the authenticated user who created the comment. The on_delete=models.SET_DEFAULT with default=1 ensures that if a user account is deleted, their comments are not lost but are instead assigned to a default user (User ID 1 in this case).

content: A TextField that holds the actual text of the comment. It has a default value of "Default comment content" for migration purposes.

created_at: A DateTimeField automatically set when the comment is first created (auto_now_add=True).

updated_at: A DateTimeField automatically updated whenever the comment is saved (auto_now=True), reflecting the last modification time.

active: A BooleanField (defaulting to True) that can be used for comment moderation, allowing administrators to hide comments if necessary.

3. Adding a Comment
Users can add new comments directly from the blog post detail page.

How to Post a New Comment:
Navigate to a Post Detail Page: Click on any blog post title or "Read more" link from the main blog list.

Authentication: To post a comment, you must be logged in. If you are not logged in, a message "Log in to post a comment." will be displayed with a link to the login page.

Fill the Form: Below the post content and existing comments, you will find a comment form. Enter your comment text into the "Content" field.

Submit: Click the "Add comment" button.

Upon successful submission, the page will reload, and your new comment will appear at the bottom of the comments list. A success message ("Your comment has been posted successfully.") will be displayed.

4. Viewing Comments
All approved comments associated with a specific blog post are displayed on its detail page.

Display on Post Detail Page:
Comments are listed below the main post content.

Each comment shows the author's username, how long ago the comment was posted ({{ comment.created_at|timesince }} ago), and the comment content.

Comments are ordered by their creation time (created_at), with the oldest comments appearing first.

5. Editing a Comment
Comment authors have the ability to edit their own comments.

Who can edit:
Only the original author of a comment can edit it.

Users must be logged in to attempt an edit.

How to access the edit form:
View the Post Detail Page: Go to the blog post containing the comment you wish to edit.

Locate Your Comment: Find the comment you authored.

Click "Edit": Next to your comment, you will see an "Edit" link. Click on it.

Update Content: The edit form will pre-populate with your existing comment content. Make your desired changes.

Submit: Click "Update Comment".

Upon successful update, you will be redirected back to the post detail page, and a success message ("Your comment has been updated successfully.") will be displayed. If you attempt to edit a comment you didn't author, an error message will appear.

6. Deleting a Comment
Comment authors can also delete their own comments.

Who can delete:
Only the original author of a comment can delete it.

Users must be logged in to attempt a deletion.

How to access the delete confirmation:
View the Post Detail Page: Go to the blog post containing the comment you wish to delete.

Locate Your Comment: Find the comment you authored.

Click "Delete": Next to your comment, you will see a "Delete" link. Click on it.

Confirm Deletion: You will be taken to a confirmation page displaying your comment. Click "Confirm Delete" to proceed.

Cancel Deletion: If you change your mind, click "Cancel" to return to the post.

Upon successful deletion, you will be redirected back to the post detail page, and a success message ("Your comment has been deleted successfully.") will be displayed. If you attempt to delete a comment you didn't author, an error message will appear.

7. Visibility and Permissions
Comment Visibility: Only comments with active=True are displayed on the blog post detail page. This field allows for moderation if an administrator needs to hide a comment.

User Permissions:

Posting: Requires authentication.

Viewing: All users (authenticated or anonymous) can view active comments.

Editing/Deleting: Strictly limited to the authenticated author of the specific comment. The system enforces this by checking if comment.author == request.user in the views (edit_comment and delete_comment). Unauthorized attempts are redirected with an error message.
