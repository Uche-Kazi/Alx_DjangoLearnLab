Blog Feature Documentation
This document explains how to use the key features of the Django Blog application, specifically the tagging and search functionalities.

1. Tagging Posts
Tagging allows you to categorize your blog posts, making it easier for users to find related content.

For the Administrator (You)
For the Administrator (You)
Log in to your Django admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.

Navigate to the Posts section.

Click on an existing post or create a new one.

In the post editing page, find the Tags field.

Enter your tags separated by commas. For example: python, django, tutorial, web development.

Click Save. The tags will now be associated with that post.

For the User
Viewing Tags: On the main blog page, each post will display the tags associated with it.

Filtering by Tag: To see all posts with a specific tag, simply click on the tag name. The page will refresh to show only posts that share that tag.

2. Searching for Content
The search functionality allows users to find specific posts based on keywords in the post title or body.

For the User
Access the Search Bar: The search bar is located on the top of the blog page.

Enter Keywords: Type your search query into the search bar. This can be a word, a phrase, or a combination of terms.

Initiate Search: Press the "Enter" key or click the search icon.

View Results: The page will display a list of posts that contain your keywords. The results are ordered by relevance, with the most relevant posts appearing first.

Refining Search: If your initial search yields too many or too few results, try using more specific keywords to narrow down your search.

Important Notes
Case Insensitivity: The search function is not case-sensitive, meaning a search for "Django" will return the same results as "django".

Partial Matches: The search will also find partial matches. For example, a search for "web" will find posts containing "web development."
